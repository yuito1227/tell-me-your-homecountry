# Attracting Contributors
As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

# Requirements
To complete the assignment, please do the following:
1. Fork this project and then rename the title to your hobby. 
2. Announce the new project and try to attract other members.
3. Make 10 Pull Request contributions to other projects
4. Merge 10 Pull Requests into your forked Project.

# My Project (Type of GPU you are using).
Please tell me about the GPU you are using.
For research or personal use, either OK.
If you have time, we would also appreciate it if you could describe the intended use in the Discussion.
If you are willing to help me with my project, please add the type of GPU you are using to the list.

For example, I use "GTX3070" for research purposes (machine learning, running 3D engines like Unity, etc.) as well as for playing online games.

I'm looking forward to your effort.

# List of GPU.
1. GTX 1066 super
2. GTX 1650
3. M1
